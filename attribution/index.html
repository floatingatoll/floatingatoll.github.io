"Caroline Thompson, 27, a contributing writer for Vice, said she downloaded Surkus and attended an event last year at a Chicago club full of “finance bros” on a Thursday night. “It was a little weird that probably 80 percent of the women at the club were there because of the app,” she said."</blockquote>

"Unfortunately, none of the hate mail had any helpful criticism," the couple told Farivar. "It was all along the lines of 'I'm too good for that job at that price' or 'you should get a wife' or 'you are terrible people.' I think all reflective of either jealousy, sexism or entitlement."</blockquote>

The music’s too loud, the lights are too bright, the streets, subways and buses are sardine tins. The relentless sensory overload — from the cinnamon smells to the Salvation Army bells — fuels agitation and an impulse to escape. How convenient, then, that there appears to be one obvious route through the chaos: buy that Nintendo Wii or that iPad or that designer perfume — whatever you’ve been wavering over — and be done with it.</blockquote>

Shoppers who had made an unplanned purchase spent, on average, $32.89 more when music was playing than those in the control condition. When a scent was present, they spent about $8.66 less. Contemplative buyers spent about $1.00 less than usual when music played, but in the presence of the citrus smell, they spent $5.71 more than usual.</blockquote>
