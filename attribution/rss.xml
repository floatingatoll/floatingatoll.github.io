Ms. James wakes up in a city where the median home price is below $300,000, according to the online real estate database company Zillow. Prices rise steadily along her commute until she gets off her last train in San Francisco, where a typical home costs more than $1 million.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/18/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 18:47:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>17</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/17/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
Not enough water, and the guaiacol won’t bubble up into the nostrils of your whiskey-swilling patrons. Too much, and your angry customers spit out the flavorless, watered down spirits.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/17/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 18:20:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>16</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/16/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
This process includes a newly discovered enzyme that decarboxylates tryptophan, an enzyme that adds a hydroxyl group, an enzyme that catalyzes phosphorylation, and an enzyme that mediates two sequential amine methylation steps. With that knowledge in hand, the team designed a one-pot reaction using three of the enzymes to prepare psilocybin from 4-hydroxy-L-tryptophan.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/16/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 07:01:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>15</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/15/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

For most of these users, there’s a really good chance that they’ve had to bear the same song automatically playing every time their device is plugged in. Rezhami’s song, then, is somewhat of a quick fix for this issue.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/14/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 07:00:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>13</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/13/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
Under the right conditions, the silk itself helps amplify a laser's power, to the point where it can either cut the silk in specific locations, or soften it to the point where it can be bent or welded. The work relies on a physics effect termed "nonlinear multiphoton interactions."&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/13/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 07:00:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>12</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/12/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
Caroline Thompson, 27, a contributing writer for Vice, said she downloaded Surkus and attended an event last year at a Chicago club full of “finance bros” on a Thursday night. “It was a little weird that probably 80 percent of the women at the club were there because of the app,” she said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/12/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 06:57:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>11</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/11/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

"Unfortunately, none of the hate mail had any helpful criticism," the couple told Farivar. "It was all along the lines of 'I'm too good for that job at that price' or 'you should get a wife' or 'you are terrible people.' I think all reflective of either jealousy, sexism or entitlement."&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/10/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 06:51:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>9</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/9/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
So, in the Baldur’s Gate pocket of the D&amp;amp;D world, if you are so unimportant in the grand design that your highest purpose is to be one of 30 anonymous villagers wiped off the map by a fireball, then that is your gender.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/9/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 10:25:40 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
