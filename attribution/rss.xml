"Caroline Thompson, 27, a contributing writer for Vice, said she downloaded Surkus and attended an event last year at a Chicago club full of “finance bros” on a Thursday night. “It was a little weird that probably 80 percent of the women at the club were there because of the app,” she said."&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/13/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 06:57:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>12</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/12/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

"Unfortunately, none of the hate mail had any helpful criticism," the couple told Farivar. "It was all along the lines of 'I'm too good for that job at that price' or 'you should get a wife' or 'you are terrible people.' I think all reflective of either jealousy, sexism or entitlement."&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/10/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 06:51:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>9</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/9/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
“If you have a big scene with a battle going on with many creatures potentially dying, [those creatures] could be assigned to EXTRA3, and then in scripting you could see when 30 EXTRA3 creatures have died.” So, in the Baldur’s Gate pocket of the D&amp;amp;D world, if you are so unimportant in the grand design that your highest purpose is to be one of 30 anonymous villagers wiped off the map by a fireball, then that is your gender.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/9/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 10:25:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>8</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/8/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

The relentless sensory overload — from the cinnamon smells to the Salvation Army bells — fuels agitation and an impulse to escape. How convenient, then, that there appears to be one obvious route through the chaos: buy that Nintendo Wii or that iPad or that designer perfume — whatever you’ve been wavering over — and be done with it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/8/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 10:06:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>7</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/7/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
Shoppers who had made an unplanned purchase spent, on average, $32.89 more when music was playing than those in the control condition. When a scent was present, they spent about $8.66 less. Contemplative buyers spent about $1.00 less than usual when music played, but in the presence of the citrus smell, they spent $5.71 more than usual.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/7/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 10:04:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>6</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/6/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

To test how mountain goats reacted to predators, Mr. Sarmento dressed up as a bear and presented himself to goats at both tourist and backcountry sites, noting their responses (yes, this is a credible technique used in ecology research).&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/5/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 10:03:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>4</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/4/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
After multiple inquiries by News4, the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute said Monday afternoon that the van and van driver are part of a study they are conducting on driverless cars.
