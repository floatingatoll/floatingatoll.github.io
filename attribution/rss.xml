You should expect your team to tell you who they are actually creating something for. Who will directly benefit from the work. And a real life individual person they will consult with on questions and who can verify it meets their expectations, at least. If your team is working in a vacuum, it’s a sure sign they’re working on the wrong thing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/10/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 10:43:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>9</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/9/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
“If you have a big scene with a battle going on with many creatures potentially dying, [those creatures] could be assigned to EXTRA3, and then in scripting you could see when 30 EXTRA3 creatures have died.” So, in the Baldur’s Gate pocket of the D&amp;amp;D world, if you are so unimportant in the grand design that your highest purpose is to be one of 30 anonymous villagers wiped off the map by a fireball, then that is your gender.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/9/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 10:25:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>8</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/8/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
The music’s too loud, the lights are too bright, the streets, subways and buses are sardine tins. The relentless sensory overload — from the cinnamon smells to the Salvation Army bells — fuels agitation and an impulse to escape. How convenient, then, that there appears to be one obvious route through the chaos: buy that Nintendo Wii or that iPad or that designer perfume — whatever you’ve been wavering over — and be done with it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/8/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 10:06:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>7</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/7/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
Shoppers who had made an unplanned purchase spent, on average, $32.89 more when music was playing than those in the control condition. When a scent was present, they spent about $8.66 less. Contemplative buyers spent about $1.00 less than usual when music played, but in the presence of the citrus smell, they spent $5.71 more than usual.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/7/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 10:04:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>6</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/6/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
It’s amazing how many people will ask if they can stop coming to meetings when you talk through 10 different ‘a’ options.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/6/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 10:04:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>5</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/5/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
To test how mountain goats reacted to predators, Mr. Sarmento dressed up as a bear and presented himself to goats at both tourist and backcountry sites, noting their responses (yes, this is a credible technique used in ecology research).&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/5/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 10:03:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>4</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/4/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
After multiple inquiries by News4, the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute said Monday afternoon that the van and van driver are part of a study they are conducting on driverless cars. The worker was wearing the uniform he was supposed to wear.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/4/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 09:26:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>3</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/3/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
Even the best-trained and most responsible federal agents — and I mean this with the utmost respect — tend to act like coked-up raccoons when you turn them loose with a search warrant. They seize stuff haphazardly, based on very odd internal definitions of what "evidence" is.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/3/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 09:16:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>2</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/2/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
On February 16, 2015, I sat down with Craft just outside of Ithaca, N.Y., and asked him about his recollections of Arecibo, the data visualizations in his thesis and the Unknown Pleasures album cover.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/2/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 08:48:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>1</title><link>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/1/</link><dc:creator>Richard Soderberg</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have never met an automaton that literally could not, though I have met some that theoretically would not and hypothetically might want to stop.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><guid>https://floatingatoll.github.io/attribution/posts/1/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 08:32:33 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
